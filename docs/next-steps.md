# Scenario Maker next steps

## Current state

Phase 1 is accepted and closed. Phase 2 is unblocked but has not been authorized or started.

## Work completed in the closeout chat

1. Read and followed the repository tracker and domain procedures, root context, and Scenario Maker skill.
2. Rechecked the live GitHub tracker with authenticated `gh` commands.
3. Confirmed:
   - Decision map issue #1 remained open with all 16 decision children closed.
   - Roadmap issue #2 remained open.
   - Phase 1 issue #3 was open, assigned to `lfelipegg`, and had zero open blockers.
   - Its existing handoff comment still contained stale pre-review counts.
   - Phase 2 issue #4 was open, unassigned, and blocked by open Phase 1 issue #3 plus closed decision issue #18.
4. Presented a bounded closeout decision through OMP's interactive `ask` tool.
5. Received explicit maintainer acceptance of Phase 1 and authorization for the final tracker update.
6. Posted the authoritative Phase 1 acceptance comment:
   - https://github.com/lfelipegg/scenario-maker-skill/issues/3#issuecomment-5770816879
7. Closed Phase 1 issue #3 only after recording the explicit acceptance.
8. Rechecked the roadmap dependency state:
   - Phase 1 issue #3 is closed.
   - Phase 2 issue #4 remains open and unassigned.
   - Phase 2 now has zero open blockers.
   - Its recorded dependencies, issues #3 and #18, are both closed.
9. Did not begin or authorize Phase 2.
10. Committed Review 24 as `b79c48b` with message `Record twenty-fourth human review batch`.
11. Did not push.

## Worktree state

After the Review 24 commit, a later commit `aa06207` recorded the previously user-owned `.gitignore` and `references/wildcard/` changes. They are no longer uncommitted worktree changes.

At the latest check, the only uncommitted path was this newly requested, untracked `docs/next-steps.md`. Do not modify `.gitignore` or `references/wildcard/` unless the authorized task requires it.

## Required next decision

Do not infer Phase 2 authorization from Phase 1 acceptance or from Phase 2 having zero open blockers.

Before any Phase 2 tracker mutation or implementation:

1. Read the repository guidance listed in the continuation prompt below.
2. Recheck live issue #4, its dependencies, assignment, and comments using authenticated `gh`.
3. Use OMP's interactive `ask` tool to obtain an explicit decision to:
   - authorize and claim Phase 2;
   - discuss Phase 2 scope before deciding; or
   - pause without tracker or implementation changes.
4. If Phase 2 is authorized, follow the issue-tracker claim procedure before implementation.
5. Do not commit or push unless separately authorized.

Continue Scenario Maker after Phase 1 closeout in:

/home/mothmanex/.agents/skills/scenario-maker

First read and follow:

- /home/mothmanex/.agents/skills/scenario-maker/docs/agents/issue-tracker.md
- /home/mothmanex/.agents/skills/scenario-maker/docs/agents/domain.md
- /home/mothmanex/.agents/skills/scenario-maker/CONTEXT.md
- /home/mothmanex/.agents/skills/scenario-maker/docs/next-steps.md
- skill://scenario-maker

If `docs/adr/` exists, read applicable ADRs. Use OMP's interactive `ask` tool for every user decision.

Current committed state:

- Latest commit: `aa06207` — `all`
- Review 24 is its parent commit: `b79c48b` — `Record twenty-fourth human review batch`.
- `master` matches `origin/master`; both commits are published.

Phase 1 state:

- Phase 1 was explicitly accepted by the maintainer.
- Final acceptance comment:
  https://github.com/lfelipegg/scenario-maker-skill/issues/3#issuecomment-5770816879
- Phase 1 issue #3 is closed.
- Authoritative evaluation: 63/0/0 mechanical and 105/3/0 human.
- The three failures are advisory case-10 attempts 1–3 `C10-ANALYSIS` failures.
- No hard criterion is failed or not-run.
- Evaluation directory: `evals/results/2026-09-21-human-review-24/`

Live tracker state at the last check:

- Decision map #1: open; all 16 decision children closed.
- Roadmap #2: open.
- Phase 1 #3: closed and assigned to `lfelipegg`.
- Phase 2 #4: open, unassigned, and has zero open blockers.
- Phase 2's recorded dependencies, #3 and #18, are both closed.
- Phases #5–#9 remain open, unassigned, and blocked in sequence.

Phase 2 has not been authorized or started. Do not infer authorization from its zero-blocker state.

Required next action:

1. Recheck live Phase 2 issue #4, its dependencies, assignment, and comments with authenticated `gh`, following `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
2. Use OMP's interactive `ask` tool for one bounded decision:
   - explicitly authorize and claim Phase 2;
   - discuss Phase 2 scope before deciding; or
   - pause without tracker or implementation mutation.
3. If and only if Phase 2 is explicitly authorized:
   - re-read the issue immediately before claiming it;
   - confirm it remains open, unassigned, and has zero open blockers;
   - assign it to `@me` using the documented tracker procedure;
   - record the authorization and execution boundary as appropriate;
   - then implement only the Phase 2 scope.
4. Do not commit or push unless separately and explicitly authorized.

Latest worktree state:

- The previously user-owned `.gitignore` and `references/wildcard/` changes were committed in `aa06207`; do not modify them unless the authorized task requires it.
- `docs/next-steps.md` is the only uncommitted path at the last check. Preserve it unless explicitly asked to commit it.

Do not modify model profiles, scene-preservation rules, tag handling, wildcard behavior, or later-phase implementation unless the explicitly authorized Phase 2 scope requires it. Do not begin Phase 3 or later work.
