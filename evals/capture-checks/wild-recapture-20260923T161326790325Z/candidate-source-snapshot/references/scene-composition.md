# Scene Composition

Use after [Request Routing](routing.md) and before model-facing wording. A scene description is the visible content to communicate, not a model dialect or a required output schema. Keep it internal unless the user asks to see it; do not expose planning JSON or add a planning section to a prompt-only response.

## Extract Before Expressing

Read the brief, supplied prompt, and any available source image together. Identify only what applies:

- Subjects and their attributes, including counts and which attributes belong to which subject.
- Actions and spatial relationships: who does what, with which object, and where.
- Setting and composition, including placement, framing, and requested perspective.
- Visual treatment: style, palette, lighting, and materials.
- Required visible text, with its exact spelling, case, punctuation, and the object that carries it.
- Locked details, other supplied facts and necessary implications, permitted changes, and exclusions.

Missing fields remain unspecified until the operation, scope, and invention mode permit completion. These categories are not a checklist to fill. Do not infer active rain from a wet street, add equipment from an occupation, or import scenery from a model example. Separate supplied content from optional inventions so the latter can be removed without losing the former. In Wild, an interpretation chosen for an ambiguous new-creation seed is an invention, never a fact inferred from evidence.

Apply [Constraints and Revisions](constraints-and-revisions.md) to decide what may change. Infer these permissions from ordinary language; do not require the user to supply a schema or choose a mode when the default is sufficient.

For an audiovisual H3 task, also retain intended sound, exact dialogue or lyrics, source-role bindings, and temporal order under the [H3 profile](models/minimax-h3.md). This augments the visual scene description without changing its definition. A source's presence alone does not choose which properties to transfer. Wild can authorize bounded audiovisual invention only as defined in [Constraints and Revisions](constraints-and-revisions.md#wild-audiovisual-permission).

## Operations

| Operation | Work on the scene description |
| --- | --- |
| **Create** | Construct from the brief, retaining every supplied fact. Complete only unspecified, permitted details; Balanced by default. |
| **Expand** | Add compatible detail within the existing content and scope; Balanced by default. More words do not require more objects or events. |
| **Adapt** | Keep the scene; change its model-facing expression. Preserve by default, even if another dialect favors different compositions or vocabulary. |
| **Revise** | Change the requested attributes or relationships, preserving everything else. Preserve by default; permission is local to the requested change. |
| **Critique** | Identify problems and explain relevant trade-offs. Suggestions are not permission to apply them; do not silently replace the prompt. |

For compound requests, apply each permission locally. “Adapt and invent background details” opens the background while preserving the subjects. “Adapt, Explore” does not by itself authorize new scene content. A comparison remains analysis unless prompts are also requested.

For Wild creation or expansion, first extract the supplied facts, source roles, exclusions, scope, and permitted changes above. Then identify the dimensions left open, choose one distinctive organizing idea, and develop mutually supporting visible or audible details only within those dimensions. Do not use a fixed brainstorming quota, novelty score, external skill call, or extra output section.

For animation, “animate …; go wild” explicitly permits development of future motion within the opening constraints. Preserve the actual opening separately from subsequent progression; this permission does not let an adaptation rewrite its source.

## Express in the Requested Dialect

Once content and permissions are resolved, apply [Output Contracts](output-contracts.md), [Prompt Types](prompt-types.md), and the applicable model or task reference. Model profiles determine compatible expression, not a different scene. Task templates describe relevant fields, not mandatory invention.

- Preserve subject counts, colors, props, actions, spatial relationships, and required lettering across prose, generic tags, and model-specific tags.
- Preserve relationships explicitly. Listing two objects separately does not establish which is left of the other or who holds what.
- Grouped canonical attributes may express an unambiguous single-subject association; do not turn every attribute group into prose. Use the minimal literal or relational fallback permitted by the output contract when tags cannot carry required meaning.
- Keep exclusions effective in the requested artifact without adding an unsolicited negative-prompt section. Do not turn an excluded object into positive scene content or negate a required element.
- Length defaults are targets, not quotas. Prefer a complete sparse prompt over invented padding. For hard limits, remove redundancy and optional invention before considering a clarification.

## Final Fidelity Check

Compare the final artifact with the source and the locally authorized changes, not merely with its intermediate wording. Check subject/attribute binding, counts, props, actions, relationships, exact lettering and its carrier, exclusions, and locked details. Reject additions outside the permitted mode or scope. In a narrow revision, the requested difference should be the only scene change; in an adaptation, there should be no scene change.

For Wild, then check that permitted inventions serve one coherent concept rather than accumulating unrelated surprises. Remove optional invention before violating hard length or format constraints.

Keep this check internal. Return the requested prompt, analysis, pair, or batch shape without unsolicited explanations or alternative outputs; only the bounded H3 enhancement offer in [Output Contracts](output-contracts.md) is excepted.
